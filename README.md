# ARPG_UEFN_Plus_Enemies
Advanced ARPG UEFN Character and Enemies Plugin.
Updated the UEFN ABP layouts to now include 180 strafing and stream lined the entire Link Layered system, also created base enemy system with wall climbing. Condensed the enemy link layered system to include all combat styles. Now you only need to duplicate the enemy Unarmed layer with your combat style and add the animation sequences.

You must own Advanced ARPG System to use, there are no Core Blueprint Files included with this plugin.
